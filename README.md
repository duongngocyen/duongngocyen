# Hi there! I'm Yen 👋

I'm a **final-year student** at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).

## About Me
I am currently an **AI Research Intern** at [Blue Raven AI](https://blueravenai.com/), where we build **LLMs for Automatic Theorem Proving** in Lean4. I'm passionate about **AI** and **NLP**, particularly in reasoning. I also enjoy writing in my free time, and hopefully, I will manage to publish one day! ✍️
